# The IEC 61162 Python Package

# Description

The IEC 61162 Python Package implements parts of the IEC 61162 series of standards, 'Maritime Navigation and Radiocommunication Equipment and Systems - Digital Interfaces'. Currently, support is included for the following parts:

* Part 1, 'Single talker and multiple listeners'; and
* Part 450, 'Multiple talkers and multiple listeners - Ethernet interconnection'.

The package has been developed using Python v.3.11.1.

## Installation

1. Ensure [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/) dependency manager are installed.

1. Clone the GRAD `py_iec_61162` repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/gla-rad/py_iec_61162.git
    ```

1. Navigate to the local repository.
    ```
    cd py_iec_61162
    ```

1. Install the IEC 61162 package and its dependencies from the `pdm.lock` file.
    ```
    pdm sync --prod
    ```
    Upon successful execution of the above command, `pdm` will generate a virtual Python environment in `./.venv/` and install the package along with its required dependencies into it in *production mode*.

## Code Usage

The main modules of the Rec. ITU-R M.1371 package are located under `./src/iec_61162/`. The code is structured as outlined below.

For examples of usage, see the source code in this repository and the repositories linked under 'Related Projects'.

### Subpackage: `part_1`

#### Module: `sentences.py`

This module contains classes and functions for representing, generating and, in the future, parsing presenation interface sentences compliant with the IEC 61162-1:2016 standard.

Currently, support has been implemented for the following sentence formatters:
* BBM, 'AIS binary broadcast message'; and
* VDM, 'AIS VHF data-link message'.

### Subpackage: `part_450`

#### Module: `messages.py`

This module contains classes and functions for representing, generating and, in the future,
parsing messages compliant with the IEC 61162-450:2018 standard.

Currently, support has been implemented for messages encapsulating IEC 61162-1-like sentences.
